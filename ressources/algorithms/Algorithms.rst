This section is for those who are interested about the common algorithms that
are used in digital image processing.

I tried my best to explain everything in layman's terms.
Math is not heavy, and I tried to explain in detail what's happening when it
goes beyond the simple high school math.

Though some subjects include code samples. Don't pay attention to them.
The real demonstrations would be available in the algorithms section of
the tutorials.

This area is mostly for notes, references and some examplary code to experiment.
